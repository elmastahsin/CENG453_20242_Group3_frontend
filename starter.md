Based on the project description in the PDF, I'll break down the Phase 3 requirements into specific steps for developing the frontend part of your UNO game using JavaFX. Here's a comprehensive plan:

## Phase 3 - Frontend Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Project Setup and JavaFX Integration
- Create a new JavaFX project with Spring Boot integration
- Configure Maven dependencies for JavaFX
- Set up the project structure (MVC pattern recommended)
- Initialize the application bootstrap class
- Configure application properties

### Step 2: Login and Registration UI with Backend Integration
- Create login screen with username and password fields
- Implement registration page with form validation
- Design password reset functionality (email verification)
- Connect to backend authentication APIs
- Implement session management
- Add error handling for authentication failures

### Step 3: Main Menu and Navigation
- Design main menu screen with play, leaderboard, and settings options
- Implement navigation controller between screens
- Create transition animations between scenes
- Add user profile information display
- Implement logout functionality

### Step 4: Leaderboard UI
- Create leaderboard screen with tabs for weekly, monthly, and all-time rankings
- Implement API calls to fetch leaderboard data
- Design user score display format
- Add filtering and sorting options
- Implement refresh functionality

### Step 5: Game Board Design
- Design the main game board layout
- Create card visual components with appropriate styling
- Implement player hand areas (all four visible in single-player mode)
- Design direction and turn indicators
- Create UNO indicator for each player
- Add central discard pile area
- Design draw pile area

### Step 6: Card Implementation
- Create card component classes for all card types
- Implement visual representations for different card colors/numbers
- Design special card visuals (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, Wild Draw Four)
- Implement card selection and highlighting
- Add animation for card movement

### Step 7: Single Player Game Logic
- Implement game initialization (dealing 7 cards to each player)
- Create turn management system
- Implement valid card checking logic
- Design CPU player behavior algorithm
- Add draw card functionality
- Implement UNO declaration system
- Add game completion detection and winner declaration

### Step 8: Special Card Mechanics
- Implement Skip card functionality
- Add Reverse card direction changing
- Implement Draw Two card stacking mechanics
- Create Wild card color selection UI
- Implement Wild Draw Four card restriction logic
- Add the special card cheat buttons functionality

### Step 9: Game State Management
- Design game state tracking system
- Implement save/load game functionality
- Create game event logging
- Add score calculation system
- Implement API calls to update player scores

### Step 10: Testing and Refinement
- Create unit tests for game logic
- Implement UI testing
- Test backend integration
- Perform cross-platform compatibility testing
- Add game settings and customization options
- Polish UI elements and animations

### Step 11: Final Integration and Deployment
- Connect all components into a cohesive application
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add loading screens and progress indicators
- Create final build configuration
- Prepare for distribution

Each step should be implemented sequentially, with thorough testing between steps to ensure everything works correctly before moving on. The most crucial aspects are the game board design, card mechanics implementation, and proper backend integration for authentication and leaderboard functionality.




# UNO Game Project Analysis Memorandum

## Current State
- The project has a functional UI with card display and basic interaction
- User authentication (login/registration) and session management are implemented
- Basic card models and color definitions are in place
- The game interface shows player cards, opponent cards, discard pile, and game controls

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Missing Game Logic Implementation**: The game appears to be playing cards randomly because there's no proper game engine to enforce UNO rules
2. **Lack of Turn Management**: No system to properly track and enforce whose turn it is
3. **No Card Validation**: Cards can be played without checking if the move is valid according to UNO rules
4. **Static Card Generation**: Cards are hardcoded in the UI rather than being dynamically generated
5. **Disconnected Models**: Card model classes exist but aren't fully integrated with the controller

## What Should Be Done
1. Create a dedicated `GameEngine` or `GameService` class to:
   - Manage the game state
   - Enforce UNO game rules
   - Handle turn management
   - Validate card plays

2. Properly integrate the existing Card model classes with the GameController

3. Implement AI logic for computer players that follows proper UNO strategy

4. Create a dynamic card dealing and management system

5. Add proper game event handling (skip turn, reverse, draw cards, etc.)

This memorandum serves as a reference for the next steps needed to transform the UNO game from a UI skeleton to a fully functional game with proper game logic and rules enforcement.
