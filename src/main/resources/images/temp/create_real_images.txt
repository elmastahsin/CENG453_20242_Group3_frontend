IMPORTANT: Create the following images for the UNO game UI:

1. src/main/resources/images/top-cards.png - A decorative image of UNO cards spread in top-right corner
2. src/main/resources/images/bottom-cards.png - A decorative image of UNO cards spread in bottom-left corner
3. src/main/resources/images/arrow-clockwise.png - A clockwise direction indicator arrow
4. src/main/resources/images/arrow-counterclockwise.png - A counter-clockwise direction indicator arrow
5. src/main/resources/images/card-back.png - The back side design of UNO cards
6. src/main/resources/images/card-9-red.png - A sample red 9 UNO card

These images are required for the UI to render correctly. You can find example designs in the referenced screenshot provided.

Note that these are temporary placeholder files. You should replace them with proper images that match the UNO game style.

The UI is designed with a modern gradient background (pink to orange for login, red to blue for game) and follows the visual style from the reference image.

If you need to create additional card images, place them in the src/main/resources/images/cards/ directory following the naming pattern:
- For number cards: card-[number]-[color].png (e.g., card-5-blue.png)
- For special cards: card-[type]-[color].png (e.g., card-skip-green.png, card-wild.png)
